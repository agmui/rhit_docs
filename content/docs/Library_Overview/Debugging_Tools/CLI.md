The CLI class can be conneted to
the serial monitor and have commands sent to it via the usb cable. This is so you can "peek"
at any value or inter state such as the motor position or write simple tests to run on the pico.
To do this can just add your own commands with this [add demo](#adding-cli-cmd).
